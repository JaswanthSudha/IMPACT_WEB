					The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition of
					Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales and
					Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.
					English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by the
					Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its content
					is written independently of other editions[1] in various varieties of
					English, aiming to stay consistent within articles. Its internal
					newspaper is The Signpost. English Wikipedia is the most-read version
					of Wikipedia,[2][3] accounting for 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative
					traffic, with the remaining percentage split among the other
					languages.[4] The English Wikipedia has the most articles of any
					edition, at 6,801,178 as of March 2024.[5] It contains 10.8% of
					articles in all Wikipedias,[5] although it lacks millions of articles
					found in other editions.[1] The edition's one-billionth edit was made
					on January 13, 2021.[6] English Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for
					Wikipedia overall, has been praised for its enablement of the
					democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure,
					culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized
					for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women
					and ideological bias.[7][8] While its reliability was frequently
					criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater
					praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s,[9][7][10][b] having become
					an important fact-checking site.[11][12] English Wikipedia has been
					characterized as having less cultural bias than other language
					editions due to its broader editor base.[2]

					Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as
					conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by
					Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include
					"featured articles",[13] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[14]
					navigation templates,[15] the sorting of short "stub" articles into
					sub-categories,[16] dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation
					and arbitration,[17] and weekly collaborations.[18] It surpassed six
					million articles on 23 January 2020.[19] In November 2022, the total
					volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20
					gigabytes.[20] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January
					2021 by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is
					the user with the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at
					over four million.[6] Currently, there are 6,801,178 articles created
					with 914,755 files. The encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in
					all Wikipedias (down from more than 50% in 2003).[21][22] The English
					Wikipedia currently has 47,136,589 registered accounts of which 864
					are administrators.
